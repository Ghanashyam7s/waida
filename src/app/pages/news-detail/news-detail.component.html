            <h2>What is Data Security? </h2>
            <p>
              Data security is the technology of safeguard valuable and sensitive company and client information, like
              personal or monetary data. All businesses nowadays from the banking giants to the one-man business
              dealing
              in huge volumes of private and monetary data. As such, data security remains one of the vital issues for
              any serious entity.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is data security important?</h2>
            <p>The data that your company creates, collects, stores and exchanges could be a valuable asset. Think
              about
              the important information your company collects, stores, and manages. Information like monetary or
              payment
              information, intellectual property, and sensitive personal data regarding your staff and customers are a
              goldmine for hackers. Data security is the processes and technologies you ought to be used to protect
              that
              data is an important part of safeguarding your company's name and financial health.</p>
            <p>Yes, now we understand that data security is important now lets understand a few benefits: -</p>
            <p>Loss or unauthorized revelation of valuable information will be quite extortionate to a company. It is
              the reason data security is kind of useful. For instance:</p>
            <h3>Safeguards All Valuable Data</h3>
            <p>Sensitive information is not presumed to leak. Either we are talking of bank customers' details or a
              hospital's patients' info; these are crucial information that is not meant for each prying eye. Data
              security keeps all this info Safely where it is meant to be.</p>
            <h3>Important for your reputation</h3>
            <p>Any organization capable of keeping secrets also helps build the confidence of all stakeholders,
              including customers, who know their data is both safe and secure.</p>
            <h3>Marketing and Competitive Advantage</h3>
            <p>By protecting sensitive information from illegal access and disclosure, you are always one step ahead
              of
              your competition. Preventing access to your future development or expansion plans is essential to
              maintaining your competitive advantage.</p>
            <h3>Saves development and support costs</h3>
            <p>The earlier you integrate security functions into your application, the lower the costs that you may
              incur through future support and development costs in connection with code changes.</p>\
            <p>Now let us throw some light on: - </p>
            <h2>What are different data security technologies & how they work? </h2>
            <p>Data security technology comes in many forms and protects data from a growing number of threats about
              which we will explore in detail in future blogs. Most of these threats come from external sources, but
              organizations should also focus their efforts on safeguarding their data from the inside as well. There
              are many ways to protect data. In this current blog we will discuss 4 such methods in details. </p>
            <p>Let us dive in: - </p>
            <h2>Data encryption: </h2>
            <p>
              Data encryption is one of the methodologies used by firms to protect the confidentiality of digital data
              as it is stored in computer systems or servers and transmitted over the Internet or other computer
              networks. The obsolete data encryption standard (DES) has been replaced by modern encryption algorithms
              that play a key role in the security of information and communication systems.
            </p>
            <p>These algorithms ensure confidentiality and support key security initiatives including authentication,
              integrity, and non-repudiation. Authentication verifies the origin of the message, and integrity proves
              that the content of the message has not changed since it was sent. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, non-repudiation ensures that the sender of the message cannot refuse to send the message.
            </p>
            <h2>How Data Encryption Works? </h2>
            <p>The data or plain text is encrypted using an encryption algorithm and an encryption key. The process
              results in ciphertext that can only be viewed in its original form if decrypted with the correct key.
              Symmetric key ciphers use the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt a message or file. Although
              symmetric
              key encryption is much faster than asymmetric encryption, the sender must exchange the encryption key
              with
              the recipient before it can be decrypted. Because companies need to distribute and manage large amounts
              of
              keys securely, most data encryption services have adapted an asymmetric secret key exchange algorithm
              and
              use it after using a symmetrical algorithm to encrypt the data.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, asymmetric cryptography, sometimes called public key cryptography, uses two
              different
              keys, one public and one private. The public key, as it is called, can be shared by everyone, but the
              private key must be protected. The Rivest-Sharmir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem
              that is widely used to protect sensitive or vital data, especially when it is sent over an insecure
              network such as the Internet. The popularity of RSA is due to the fact that both public and private keys
              can encrypt a message to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and inevitability of
              electronic messages and data through the use of digital signatures.</p>
            <h2>Data masking: </h2>
            <p>Data masking is one of the methods to protect confidential data such as credit card details, social
              security numbers, names, addresses, and telephone numbers from unintentional disclosure to reduce the
              risk
              of data breaches. It minimizes the risk of data security breaches by masking test and development
              environments originating from production data, regardless of the database, server, platform, or
              location.
            </p>
            <p>Adopting DM (Data Masking) helps businesses to improve security and privacy. At the same time, DM helps
              them meet the requirements for compliance with security and privacy standards recommended by regulatory
              /
              audit bodies like PCI.</p>
            <h2>How Data Masking Works? </h2>
            <p>To perform static data masking, a replica of a database must be created identical to the original one
              except for the fields that need to be masked or spoofed. The dummy database does not affect its
              functionality in any way, and it is enough to simulate a database for testing or development, etc. Note,
              however, that you will need to think about additional hardware resources to store this same database and
              update it from time to time as per database alterations made in the present. One advantage is obvious:
              no
              sensitive data leaves your database hidden.</p>
            <h2>Data erasure: </h2>
            <p>
              There are times when data that is no longer active or in use needs to be deleted from all systems. For
              example, if a customer requested that their name be removed from the mailing list, the data should be
              permanently removed.
              <h2>How Data Erasure Works? </h2>
              <p>Data Erase / Data Wipe is a software overwrite method that completely destroys all electronic data on
                the hard drive. Permanently Deleting Data goes beyond basic file deletion commands, which only removes
                direct pointers to actual files and enables data recovery with popular software tools. Unlike
                demagnetization or physical destruction - which makes the drive unusable - data wiping/erasing erases
                all information, leaving the hard drive working, protection of resources and the environment. It also
                allows for remarketing and value return if the customer is looking for a residual value but not
                exposed
                to a data breach.</p>
              <p>It is entirely possible to apply a strong data security strategy that protects your most vulnerable
                data without restricting employees or affecting productivity. Thus, in our next blog we will explore
                different external threats that digital companies are facing along with more methods to protect data &
                other vital information.</p>

                protection and data security. As the digital ecosystem is evolving, our way and processes to handle
                situations are also evolving. </p>
